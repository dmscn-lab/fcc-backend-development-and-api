In the Back End Development and APIs Certification, I learned how to write back end applications with Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). I was also able to build web apps with the Express framework and build a People Finder microservice with MongoDB and the Mongoose library.

This course is available for free from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
